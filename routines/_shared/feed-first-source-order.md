# Source plan (registry-driven) + fetch mechanics (apply to ALL sections)

**FIRST research action — build today's source plan:**

    python3 tools/sources/preflight.py --slug {slug}

(your slug is the one named in your Story-deduplication section). It reads `sources/registry.yml` and prints the plan that is the AUTHORITY on what to fetch and what pressure applies today — not any table in this prompt:

- **Fetch list** — the domains/feeds affine to this stream, each with its probe URL and method (curl or proxy). Sweep these first.
- **Pressure** — per-domain notes: the max-2-stories-per-outlet-domain cap (hubs like arXiv are exempt) and `saturated` flags. Report-only for now — no story gets dropped for them — but when two sources carry the same story, prefer the unsaturated one.
- **Discovery** — this stream's discovery quota and `candidates_to_try` (registry candidates and dormant domains worth a probe this run). Work at least the quota's worth of genuinely new or dormant domains into your research; the Discovery footer line reports the outcome.

**EMERGENCY SLATE — degraded mode only (a floor, never the ceiling).** If preflight errors or prints `source-plan unavailable`, fall back to these known-good feeds and note `source-plan unavailable` in the Gaps footer:
- News desks: SRF `https://www.srf.ch/news/bnf/rss/1646`, Le Temps `https://www.letemps.ch/articles.rss`, Al Jazeera `https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml`.
- Science streams: arXiv `https://export.arxiv.org/rss/{category}` + the Atom API, Nature `https://www.nature.com/nature.rss`.
Still research beyond this floor as the brief demands — the slate is where you start when the plan is missing, never a cap on where you look.

**New-source citation rule.** T3 aggregators (HN/Reddit/X) remain never-cited. But a **genuine primary source discovered through search or a T3 lead MAY be cited immediately even if it is absent from `sources/registry.yml`** — tag it with the literal marker `[new source]` next to the citation. Tag ONLY domains genuinely absent from the registry (grep `sources/registry.yml` for the domain first): the lint at DEDUP Step C.25 recomputes novelty itself, and both a missing tag on an unregistered domain and a `[new source]` tag on a registered one are violations. This is how the registry grows — a tagged citation auto-enters the domain as a `candidate`.

## Fetch mechanics

**Fetch proxy — use it for any source that 403s a direct fetch.** A Cloudflare Worker at `https://fetch-proxy.khalic-lab.workers.dev` fetches a public URL from Cloudflare's edge with a real browser User-Agent and returns the page body; it is on the sandbox allowlist. The routine sandbox's own IP is 403'd on sight by Cloudflare/Akamai-fronted sites (lab blogs, most news HTML), so route those through the proxy:

    curl -fsSL -G "https://fetch-proxy.khalic-lab.workers.dev/" --data-urlencode "url=<TARGET URL>" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${FETCH_PROXY_TOKEN}"

- **Direct `curl` first for the allowlisted feed hosts** (`export.arxiv.org`, `www.nature.com`, `www.quantamagazine.org`, `api.semanticscholar.org`, `www.srf.ch`, `www.letemps.ch`, `www.aljazeera.com`) — they work directly and arXiv asks automated clients to use it directly. Do NOT route these through the proxy.
- **Proxy for everything else** — lab blogs (Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, Apple), tech-news HTML (CNBC, TechCrunch, VentureBeat, Bloomberg, Fortune, MarkTechPost, …), and any other host that 403s a direct `curl`. Try the proxy before treating a source as unavailable — the registry's `reach:` field (surfaced in the preflight plan) is the reachability truth; there is no static unavailable list.
- A successful proxy fetch (HTTP 200 body) is a **direct fetch** — no `[via snippet]` tag. The proxy mirrors the upstream status, so a non-200 means the site hard-blocks even the proxy (Cloudflare JS/Turnstile challenge) or is paywalled — only then fall back to a search-engine snippet and tag `[via snippet]`.
- In the `Feeds hit` / Coverage footer, mark proxied fetches `{ok via proxy}` alongside the existing `{ok via curl}` / `{ok via WebFetch}` / `{fail — HTTP NNN}`.
