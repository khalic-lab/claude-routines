# Feed-first source order (apply to ALL sections)

**Fetch proxy — use it for any source that 403s a direct fetch.** A Cloudflare Worker at `https://fetch-proxy.khalic-lab.workers.dev` fetches a public URL from Cloudflare's edge with a real browser User-Agent and returns the page body; it is on the sandbox allowlist. The routine sandbox's own IP is 403'd on sight by Cloudflare/Akamai-fronted sites (lab blogs, most news HTML), so route those through the proxy:

    curl -fsSL -G "https://fetch-proxy.khalic-lab.workers.dev/" --data-urlencode "url=<TARGET URL>" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${FETCH_PROXY_TOKEN}"

- **Direct `curl` first for the allowlisted feed hosts** (`export.arxiv.org`, `services.nvd.nist.gov`, `www.cisa.gov`, `www.nature.com`, `www.quantamagazine.org`, `api.semanticscholar.org`, `www.srf.ch`, `www.letemps.ch`, `www.aljazeera.com`) — they work directly and arXiv asks automated clients to use it directly. Do NOT route these through the proxy.
- **Proxy for everything else** — lab blogs (Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, Apple), tech-news HTML (CNBC, TechCrunch, VentureBeat, Bloomberg, Fortune, MarkTechPost, …), and any other host that 403s a direct `curl`. This SUPERSEDES the "confirmed unavailable / do-not-waste-cycles" list below for HTML pages: try the proxy before treating a source as unavailable.
- A successful proxy fetch (HTTP 200 body) is a **direct fetch** — no `[via snippet]` tag. The proxy mirrors the upstream status, so a non-200 means the site hard-blocks even the proxy (Cloudflare JS/Turnstile challenge) or is paywalled — only then fall back to a search-engine snippet and tag `[via snippet]`.
- In the `Feeds hit` / Coverage footer, mark proxied fetches `{ok via proxy}` alongside the existing `{ok via curl}` / `{ok via WebFetch}` / `{fail — HTTP NNN}`.
